# ECOTOOL
A new toolbox for time series analysis and forecasting.
Features found in a few packages or none at all:
  (1) Multi-seasonal ARIMA models.
  (2) Automatic identification of multi-seasonal ARIMAs.
  (3) Exact Maximum Likelihood estimation of ARIMA, Unobserved Components, Exponential Smoothing.
  (4) Automatic detection of outliers in ARIMA, Unobserved Components, Exponential Smoothing.
  (5) Tell ECOTOOL ARIMA models as you would write them on a paper. Impose constraints as you would like.
  (6) VARX with and without constraints.
  (7) ...

To install it just download and run ECOTOOL.mltbx.

For help type 'help ECOTOOL' at Matlab prompt.
For help for each single function type the function name without any input.
For demos showing the power and how to do things run ECOTOOLdemos(#num), where #num is a number between 1 and 11. They will show you how ECOTOOL works step by step.

Further suggestions:
   (1) All modelling functions are named model* (modelTF, modelNAIVE, modelAUTO, modelUC, modelETS, modelVARX)
   (2) Check toolTEST for descriptive statistics, identification and validation.
   (3) Check toolFORECAST for forecasting plots and error metrics.
